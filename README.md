# Lava - Virtual banking #
Simple laravel application for managing my kids virtual savings. The name Lave comes from the ide that hot cash comes flowing into the accounts ðŸ˜Ž

## How it works ##
Used to track how much money my kids save by not spending cash on saturday night candies and by doing housework. Designed to help me keep track of how much they have saved, and give them a nice overview over how much they currently have in their virtual account.

## Installation ##
```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run prod

php artisan migrate
```
